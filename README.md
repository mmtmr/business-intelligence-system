![Reseller Sales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76145646/156775533-5d44b75f-c0f5-4868-ab93-ef911e3efe9d.png)

The dashboard is an overview of the reseller sales performance between 2011 to 2013. The objective of this dashboard is to learn how the total sales amount, average sales amount, number of orders, and total sales profit of the resellers are performing every year.
Funnel charts are used to illustrate the performance of total sales amount, average sales amount, number of orders. The relationships of total sales amount, number of orders, and quarter each year are demonstrated in the area charts. The map shows how the profit generated by the resellers from different country. There are two cards to show the statistics of the total sales amount and number of resellers from the selected category. More importantly, the waterfall chart that clearly illustrates the loss and profit from reseller sales is included. From 2011 to 2013, $79.96 million of sales amount are generated by around 635 resellers worldwide.
In the timeframe between the years of 2011 and 2013, the funnel chart has shown an 84.6% increase in the sales amount from $18.19 million in 2011 to $33.57 million in 2013.
However, the sales amount only increases by 19.1% from 2012 to 2013, which indicates a slow of growth. There are two variables that cause the sudden change in growth speed of sales amount.
Firstly, the average sales amount per order decreases by 65.2% in 2013 when compared to the data in 2011. Secondly, the number of orders stops increasing drastically.  For instance, in 2012, the number of orders increases dramatically by 125%; However, in 2013, the number of orders only achieves a 28.9% growth. The halt of growth in sales amount and number of orders is the reason behind the loss of $491,870 in revenue in 2013.  In addition, it is observed that the orders are less commonly made in Q3 but more commonly made in Q1.
The company achieved a $915,900 profit in 2012. The profit in revenue is not due to the market expansion to Australia and Germany, contrary to expectations, the company suffered a $16,771 loss in Australia and a $42,434 loss in Germany that year. The profit in 2012 is majorly contributed by the orders in North America, which had doubled up from 9,655 in 2011 to 19,487 in 2012. Having said that, U.S. also made up a huge part of revenue loss in 2013, which is a loss of $153,306. A bigger part of the revenue loss came from Europe, with a total of $222,630 loss in 2013. Despite the profit loss that year, the number of orders had increased in Europe by 139% in Europe and multiplied by 22.48 in Australia.
Several assumptions can be drawn from these observations. First assumption manufacturing cost of product had increased significantly in 2013. Second assumption is the selling price of product was lowered due to low demands. The second assumption can be rejected due to the fact that the number of orders had increased in Europe and Australia. The first assumption is confirmed in Chapter 5.4. Overall, Ultra Works Cycles need to decrease the product cost in other to make profit through reseller sales.
The failure of boosting growth in revenue through market expansion in 2012 had alarmed Ultra Works Cycles. They will be prioritising the resources on Internet Sales next year.


### Internet Sales
![Internet Sales](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76145646/156775706-4c56c907-6df9-407b-9952-9e36a4bcd199.png)

The dashboard is an overview of the internet sales performance between 2011 to 2013. The objective of this dashboard is to learn how the total sales amount, average sales amount, number of orders, number of customers are performing every year. Funnel charts are used to illustrate the performance of total sales amount, average sales amount, number of orders. The relationships of total sales amount, number of orders, number of customers, and quarter each year are demonstrated in the area charts. The reason why the customer makes an order is presented in 100% stacked bar chart. There are two cards showing the statistics of the total sales amount and number of customers from the selected category. From 2011 to 2013, $29.27 million of sales amount are generated by around 17,980 customers.
Between 2011 to 2013, $29.27 million of sales are generated by around 18,000 of customer. The internet sales performed the best in 2013, with $16.34 million of sales generated, which is a 179.87% increase from 2012. The number of orders and the number of customers also increased significantly in 2013. Only a total of 5,613 orders are made online in 2011 and 2012, resulting 12.92 million of sales. In 2013, the number of orders increased by 1454.35% from 2012 and 2282.82% from 2011, where 52,801 of orders are made online that year. Similarly, the number of customers that made purchases in 2013 is 17,429, a 434.45% increase of 3,255 from 2012, and a 686.51% increase of 2216 from 2011. Conversely, on the other hand, the average sales amount of each order has been decreasing pronouncedly every year. The average sales amount in 2013 is only $309.68, which is only 9.7% of the average sales amount in 2011.
From the observation above, it is concluded that the sales amount increased in 2013 is due to the steep increase in order. The steep increase in order is directly linked to the new customers that ordered online. As shown in the area chart, the number of orders and the number of customers have a similar trendline. However, the increase in the number of customers does not always result in increase of sales amount. For example, in 2012, the number of customers increased but the total sales amount decreased. This is due to the decline of average sales amount.
The possible reason of this may be the drastic changes happening in product price or the types of products provided.
Moreover, although it may seem like the decrease of average sales amount negatively affect the total sales amount, the decrease in price is actually the reason why the customers make more orders. As shown in the 100% stacked bar chart, the orders made in 2011 are due to the reputation of manufacturer and the confidence in the product quality, each makes up of 49.84% of the order. In 2012, 50.31% of the orders are made due to promotion, 25.9% of the orders are made due to price, and 23.34% are made due to reviews. In 2013, 81.31% of the orders are made because of the price and another 11.13% are made due to promotion. This means that the products sell online has a cheaper price than the products sell by resellers. This assumption shall be further validated through the product dashboard in Chapter 5.4.
Overall, the success of internet sales in 2013 is because Ultra Works Cycles successfully attracted more customers to purchase online also by providing products with lower price. Ultra Works Cycles is also able to generate more profit compared to selling the products to reseller with a lower price. Therefore, despite the product cost is the same, the internet sales had succeeded in bringing more revenue to the company, while the reseller sales caused more loss with more orders made. Due to the high profit of internet sales, Ultra Works Cycles is suggested to prioritise the resources on the internet sales besides of reseller sales.


### Customer
![Customer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76145646/156775885-da320a7d-d225-4b1c-a6c5-8616d43a64e2.png)

The dashboard is for online customer profile analysis. Through this, the key features of customers that Ultra Works should be targeting to further improve its profit will be extracted. The result will be visualised using map diagram, scatter chart, line and column chart, pie chart, and treemap.
The two biggest online market of Ultra Works are United States and Australia, with sales amount of $9.36 million and $9.03 million, mostly contributed by the customers located at coast cities of the countries. In addition, Europe market generates a sales amount of $8.92 million. The main consumer group has commute distance between zero to one mile, while people with commute distance larger than one mile are less prevalent in the consumer group. Moreover, most of the customers of Ultra Works are house owner or have less than or equal to two children.
Furthermore, a deeper analysis on the customer’s society rank shows that there is a positive correlation between the average sales amount and the customer’s yearly income. It is reasonable that when the customer has higher income, they tend to make more expensive purchase. However, most of the sales are made by customers with less than $100,000 of income.
Besides that, customers with bachelor’s degree are most interested in making an online order, having the highest average sales amount ($558.88) and total sales amount ($9.87 million) among all the education level. Customer with a bachelor’s degree and graduate degree has the highest consumption level, followed by customer with a partial college and high school education level.
More than half of the customer has a professional occupation or a skilled manual occupation.
In conclusion, the main features of customers are located at coast cities, house owner, has commute distance less than one mile, less than or equal to two children, less than $100,000 of income, a professional occupation or a skilled manual occupation, and with bachelor’s degree.
“Cycle to Work scheme” may be one of the reasons that encourages the people with less dependents to purchase a bicycle for commute purpose. The trend, as shown in Figure below, starts at 2007, and reach its peak in 2010. Besides that, coast cities tend to be more urban, so it will be more convenient to commute to places with bicycles. Recommendations to improve sales include announce promotions at the end of summer when people are more interested to commute in bicycle and sell cheaper bicycles. Last but not least, Ultra Works Cycles should develop specific marketing strategies target the people that have main features listed in the paragraph above.

### Product
![Product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76145646/156776284-86a1cc93-c162-4295-a002-9ac66373b152.png)

The dashboard in Figure 5.5 is to compare the differences of product information provided to the reseller or sold on the internet, especially the sales amount, profit, average product price, and order quantity. These will be visualised using tree map, bar chart, and line chart. The purpose of this dashboard is to validate the assumptions made in Chapter 5.1 and 5.2.
The average product price of bicycle is generally higher when sell online. For instance, the mountain bike sold online has an average price of $2001.17, compared to the average price sold to reseller, which is only $1130.03. This observation also applies to road bike and touring bike. Road bike costs $1798.50 in average selling online and $752.22 in average selling to reseller. Touring bike costs $1774.25 in average selling online and $830.54 in average selling to reseller. The price of the bike selling online doubles up when compared to the price of the bike selling to reseller. Therefore, it is obvious than with the same product cost, products sell on the internet will generate more profit, thus validate the assumptions.
